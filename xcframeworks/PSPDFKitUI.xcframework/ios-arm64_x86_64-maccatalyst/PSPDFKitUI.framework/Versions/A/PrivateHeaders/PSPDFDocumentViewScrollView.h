/// can be used to make model-layer adjustments to your view hierarchy before they
/// are transformed to the presentation layer during layout.
///
/// ## Contents
///
/// Internally the scroll view has a `contentView`, a simple `UIView` that can be
/// used as the container for the actual content. This enables a simple support for
/// zooming as the `contentView` can simply be returned from `viewForZoomingInScrollView:`.
