/// A document view layout controls how a document is visualized on screen. It controls
/// where a spread (a set of pages) is placed on the screen and how scrolling and zooming
/// behaves.
///
/// ## Subclassing
///
/// `PSPDFDocumentViewLayout` is an abstract base class meant for subclassing. You
/// can either subclass `PSPDFContinuousScrollingLayout` or `PSPDFScrollPerSpreadLayout`
/// if you want a layout similar to these two but only need a couple of tweaks. If
/// you want to have more control but your layout still follows the general idea of
/// a layout that scrolls in a single direction, either vertically or horizontally,
/// `PSPDFStackViewLayout`, the superclass of the two aforementioned layouts, gives
/// you a lot of control while covering the basics and a couple of convenience methods
/// that make your life easier. This should be enough control for almost all designs.
/// However if your design is very specific, we also give you the same base class all
/// of our own layouts use: `PSPDFDocumentViewLayout`. With this layout you need to
/// do everything on your own but there are almost no limitations on what to do with it.
///
/// ## Spreads
///
/// The main thing that a document view layout cares about is a spread; this is what
/// it calculates the position of. A spread is a collection of pages that are always
/// viewed together. If you have the most basic layout, a layout with its spread mode
/// set to single, every spread corresponds to a single page in the document, which
/// means the amount of spreads is equal to the amount of pages. However you can also
/// have a double paged layout or a book layout. To convert between pages and spreads,
/// `PSPDFDocumentViewLayout` provides you with helper methods. To make your layout
/// work with all spread modes, it is important that you use these methods for conversion
/// and, in case you want to implement your own spreading algorithms, override these
/// methods and make them do the proper conversion, otherwise your layout may not work
/// correctly in all cases.
///
/// @see `PSPDFDocumentViewLayoutSpreadMode`
///
/// ## UICollectionViewLayout
///
/// It is very important to keep in mind that a document view layout is based on
/// `UICollectionViewLayout` and that this is what is used to calculate the position
/// of a spread on the screen in the end. `PSPDFDocumentViewLayout` and especially
/// its subclass `PSPDFStackViewLayout` offer you convenience methods that hide a lot
/// of the complexity of collection views but depending on how the layout you are building
/// should look, keep in mind that all the collection view layout methods can be used
/// as well.
///
/// While the collection view layout works with index paths as its item identifying
/// object, the document view layout does not need multiple levels of indexes. Each
/// layout only needs to deal with one section. The important identifier for a document
/// view layout is the spread index an item is representing. Therefore all the methods
/// a `PSPDFDocumentViewLayout` and its subclasses offer refer to the spread index
/// instead of an index path. For most layouts you will not come into contact with
/// any of the index path based methods, but in case you do need them, PSPDFKit offers
/// you two new methods on `NSIndexPath` to easily convert between index paths and
/// spread indexes: `+[NSIndexPath pspdf_indexPathForSpreadAtIndex:]` and
/// `-[NSIndexPath pspdf_spreadIndex]`. You should always use these methods to convert
/// back and forth between spread indexes and index paths and not make any assumptions
/// about how an index path maps to a spread index.
///
/// ## Additional APIs
///
/// Aside from the collection view layout, a document view layout also offers a few
/// additional things that the document view controller and its views use to determine
/// other behaviors, such as how zooming behaves (`spreadBasedZooming`), how spreads
/// map to pages, and how the actual view hierarchy is positioned in relation to the
/// view controller's view (`scrollViewFrameInsets`).
///
/// Make sure to use the methods `PSPDFDocumentViewLayout` and its subclasses offer
/// instead of just implementing everything by overriding the collection view layout
/// methods. If you override one of the collection view layout methods, it is up to
/// you to make sure that other methods such as `spreadIndexForPageAtIndex:`,
/// `pageRangeForSpreadAtIndex:`, `continuousSpreadIndexForContentOffset:`, or
/// `contentOffsetForContinuousSpreadIndex:` don't return conflicting values or otherwise
/// you might get unexpected results.
