/// The document view controller is the starting point for visualizing a document on

///
/// ## The Layout
///
/// The main way of controlling how a layout looks is through `PSPDFDocumentViewLayout`.
/// While PSPDFKit provides you with a set of default layouts such as a continuous
/// scrolling layout, a paginated scroll per spread layout and a curl based layout,
/// layouts are meant to be fully customizable so you can adopt PSPDFKit to your design
/// perfectly.
///
/// To customize a design you can start by changing properties on a design provided
/// by PSPDFKit. If this is not enough, `PSPDFDocumentViewLayout` and its subclasses
/// provide various levels of entry points to best fit what your desired outcome is.
///
/// You can either subclass `PSPDFContinuousScrollingLayout` or `PSPDFScrollPerSpreadLayout`
/// if you want a layout similar to these two but only need a couple of tweaks. If
/// you want to have more control but your layout still follows the general idea of
/// a layout that scrolls in a single direction, either vertically or horizontally,
/// `PSPDFStackViewLayout`, gives you a lot of control while covering the basics and
/// a couple of convenience methods that make your life easier. This should be enough
/// control for almost all designs. However if your design is very specific, we also
/// give you the same base class all of our own layouts use: `PSPDFDocumentViewLayout`.
/// With this layout you need to do everything on your own but there should be pretty
/// much no limitations on what to do with it.
///
/// To get you started with implementing your own layout, check out the documentation
/// for `PSPDFDocumentViewLayout`.
///
/// ## The Hierarchy
///
/// The document view hierarchy can be seen in the following diagram.

/// ## Continuous Spread Index
///
/// Usually you should prefer the integer based `spreadIndex` APIs. The `spreadIndex`
/// is less complex and does the necessary conversion to the continuous spread index
/// for you. However there are use cases where you need floating point precision for
/// the current scrolling position.
///
/// The `continuousSpreadIndex` maps the spreads of the document on to the viewport
/// in a size independent way. That means that no matter what size a spread is displayed
/// on and also no matter what other spread sizes are already known of a document,
/// the continuous spread index remains stable. E.g. a continuous spread index of 2.5
/// will always refer to the center of spread 2.
///
/// In the places where a continuous spread index is related to a certain position
/// in the view hierarchy, it is related to the center of the current viewport. So
/// if you call `continuousSpreadIndex` you will receive the continuous spread index
/// that is currently shown at the center of the document view controller's view.
///
/// If you implement your own custom layout and this layout does not build on top of
/// `PSPDFStackViewLayout`, you may need to deal with the continuous spread index though
/// and do calculations between the continuous spread index and the content offset
/// yourself. For that it is important how the function of the continuous spread index
/// looks. It is a monotonically increasing function over all spreads of a document.
/// Its valid range is `[0, spreadCount)`. Note that it is monotonically, but not strictly
/// monotonically increasing. The spaces between spread are not considered to be a
/// part of a spread, therefore in this area, the continuous spread index does not
/// change. E.g. spread 2 has a range of `[2, 3)`, then there is the inter-item spacing
/// between spread 2 and 3 where the continuous spread index is 3 and only when you
/// start scrolling into spread 3, the continuous spread index starts increasing again
/// in the range of `[3, 4)` for this spread.
///
