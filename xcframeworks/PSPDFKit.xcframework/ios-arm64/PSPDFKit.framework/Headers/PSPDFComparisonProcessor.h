/// # Aligning the Documents
///
/// In case the two versions of a document are not perfectly aligned, the
/// comparison processor accepts an optional transformation matrix that
/// describes how the page in the new version of a document is aligned in
/// relation to the page in the old version of a document.
///
/// You may either provide an already computed transformation matrix or two sets
/// of equivalent points from both versions of a document and let the
/// comparison processor automatically compute the transformation matrix.
///
/// You may also use the `DocumentAlignmentViewController` from the PSPDFKitUI
/// framework to initiate a process where users can visually select the two sets
/// of points themselves. See its documentation for more information.
