/// An instance of this class represents a PKCS7 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2315) cryptographic container. This container format is the most common format used
/// for signing PDFs digitally. For example, you can use an instance of this class when you want to sign a document that was
/// already prepared for deferred digital signing. One example scenario may be the following:
///
/// - Prepare a PDF document with a digital signature form field by calling `-[PSPDFSigner prepareFormElement:toBeSignedWithAppearance:contents:writingToDataSink:completion:]`.
/// - Embed the data contents of this container by calling `-[PSPDFSigner embedSignatureInFormElement:withContents:writingToDataSink:completion:]`. In your custom implementation of the `PSPDFSignatureContents` interface that you pass to this method, you can return `[PSPDFPKCS7 data]` from inside the `-[PSPDFSignatureContents signData:]` method.
