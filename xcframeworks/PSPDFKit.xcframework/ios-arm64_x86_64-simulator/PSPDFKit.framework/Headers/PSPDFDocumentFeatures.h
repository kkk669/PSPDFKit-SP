/// You can implement your own sources by conforming to this protocol. Besides the

/// control. The result of your source will be combined with the results of the framework's
/// sources through a logical AND. This means if your source disallows a feature this
/// feature is no longer available, however if your source allows a feature there might
/// still be other sources disallowing a feature. Only if all sources allow a feature,
/// the feature will be enabled.
