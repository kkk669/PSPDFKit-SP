/**
 Swizzles selector with new IMP based on a block, returning current implementation.

 In most cases, you want to capture the current IMP and call it as part of the new implementation.
 If the IMP isn't captured, it'll be lost later on.

 Example use:

     pspdf_swizzleSelectorOnce(controller.class, @selector(topLayoutGuide), ^{
        __block IMP originalTopLayoutGuideIMP = pspdf_swizzleSelectorWithBlock(controller.class, @selector(topLayoutGuide), ^(UIViewController *_self) {
            if (PSPDFControllerIsInSimplePageViewController(_self)) {
                return _self.parentViewController.topLayoutGuide;
            } else {
                return ((id<UILayoutSupport> (*)(id, SEL))originalTopLayoutGuideIMP)(_self, @selector(topLayoutGuide));
            }
