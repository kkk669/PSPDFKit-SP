/// Will call `handler` when `trigger` is called, but always adds `delay`.
/// If the object is deallocated, it might not trigger the last pending trigger action.
///
/// Typically you create one timer per method or action you want to debounce. Instead
/// of calling this method directly, you then always either call `trigger` or `triggerAndReset`
/// on the debounce timer. The debounce timer will then make sure that it does not
/// call the method or action it is set up with more often than `delay.
///
/// The first call to `trigger` will set up a timer that calls the linked action after
/// the given delay. All subsequent calls to `trigger` do nothing until the timer fires.
/// When this happens, the timer is invalidated and another call to `trigger` will start
/// this cycle again. Instead of calling `trigger` you can also call `triggerAndReset`,
/// which basically does the same with one exception: When calling `triggerAndReset`
/// while the timer is already set up, the timer's fire date is reset to fire in the
/// configured delay from now on.
