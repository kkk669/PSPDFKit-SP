@class PSPDFCacheInfo;

/// `PDFCacheMetadata` is used by the cache stores as the in memory representation
/// of the cache metadata. It does not contain the data (the image) itself as this
/// is stored in different locations depending on the type of the store; this class
/// keeps track of the metadata and therefore of what is part of the cache and what
/// is not. Think of it as a list of `PSPDFCacheInfo` objects.
///
/// The cache metadata class is very tightly coupled with the stores. It is not thread
/// safe and is meant to be used in a concurrent read / single write environment. Its
/// method names inform you about the kind of lock required to call a method. It even
/// provides you with the `accessQueue` to use, however locking itself needs to be
/// done by the caller; this is implemented in this way because usually the caller
/// needs to do their own bookkeeping of the data linked to an entry in the metadata
/// class and changes on the data and the metadata usually need to be atomic.
///
/// Methods starting with a `queue_` should be called on a single queue but can be
/// called concurrently on that queue. Methods starting with `barrier_` on the other
/// hand have to be called from a barrier block and require serial execution.
