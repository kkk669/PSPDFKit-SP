/// These points are all parts of the ellipse and are ordered in a counter clockwise
/// order.
/// - We iterate over the discrete points and calculate the center location of the arcs
/// for the cloudy style. These center locations are all on the path of the sampled
/// ellipse, but if they don't match exactly one point, we interpolate between two
/// points in the samples. This essentially creates a point that is not really on the
/// ellipse, but with ~360 sample points, they are so close to it, that this doesn't
/// matter.
/// - We then iterate over the calculated center points and determine the start and
/// end angles of every circle so that it starts and stops at the intersection points
/// with the previous / next circle.
///
