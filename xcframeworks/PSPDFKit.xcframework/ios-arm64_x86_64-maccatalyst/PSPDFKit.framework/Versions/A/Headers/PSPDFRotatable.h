/// Annotations that can be rotated conform to this protocol.

/// Rotation is supported by these annotation types:
///
/// **Free text annotations:**
///
/// - Rotating is supported in all saving configurations.
///
/// **Stamps:**
///
/// - Only supported by standard text stamps (Acrobat stamps) and vector stamps (stamps that make use of `AppearanceStreamGenerating`).
///     - These stamp types can only be rotated if the PDF document embeds the annotation into the document itself.
///       I.e. the `.embedded` annotation save mode or `.embeddedWithExternalFileAsFallback` if the file is writable.
///     - Rotation is **not** supported if the annotations are saved to an external file using the `.externalFile` save mode.
///     - Rotation is also **not** supported when using XFDF (`XFDFAnnotationProvider`) to save annotations.
/// - Rotation is **not** supported for image stamps or custom text stamps.
