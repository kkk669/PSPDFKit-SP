/// This class describes the security options you want to use when saving a PDF
/// file. Using a security options object overrides the default options of a file.
///
/// A PDF file can have multiple security-related options set. The owner password
/// generally controls the editing of a document and is required as soon as you
/// want to encrypt a document of any kind. The user password prevents users from
/// viewing the PDF. It is optional but if you specify it you also need to specify
/// an owner password.
///
/// You can also specify the key length of the encryption. This controls how large
/// the key is that is used for actually encrypting the document. The key is
/// derived from the passwords you specify. As soon as you specify at least an
/// owner password you also need to decide on a key length to be used. You can also
/// specify `PSPDFDocumentSecurityOptionsKeyLengthAutomatic` in all cases and let
/// PSPDFKit decide on if and what key length to use.
///
/// To specify what operations are allowed when opening the document with user
/// privileges you can also set `PSPDFDocumentPermissions`. With user privileges
/// you can always view the file in question and by specifying
/// `PSPDFDocumentPermissions` you can grant further rights that otherwise would
/// only be available when the user has owner privileges.
///
/// PSPDFKit supports two encryption algorithms: RC4 and AES. RC4 is a proprietary
/// encryption algorithm of RSA Security Inc. It is a symmetric stream cipher,
/// ie. the same algorithm is used for both encryption and decryption, and the
/// algorithm does not change the length of the data. AES support was introduced with
/// PDF 1.6. It is a symmetric block cipher, ie. the same algorithm is used for both
/// encryption and decryption, and the length of the data when encrypted is rounded up
/// to a multiple of the block size, which is fixed in this implementation to always be
/// 16 bytes.
///
/// @note In order to use this class, you need a license that enables you to use
/// the Document Editor. If you want to process a file while keeping the options of
/// the original file, simply pass `nil` for security options.
